# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects that focus on three primary areas: training predictive models, visualizing data, and implementing linear regression algorithms. Each project is designed to provide practical experience with different machine learning concepts using real-world datasets. The goal is to develop models that can accurately predict outcomes and uncover insights through data analysis.

## Projects

### 1. Predictive Modeling
- **Description**: Projects in this category involve building and training models to forecast future data points based on historical data.
- **Technologies Used**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

### 2. Data Visualization
- **Description**: These projects emphasize creating interactive visual representations of data to help understand underlying patterns and trends.
- **Technologies Used**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

### 3. Linear Regression
- **Description**: This section includes projects that apply linear regression techniques to both simple and multiple regression problems to predict quantitative outcomes.
- **Technologies Used**: NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels
